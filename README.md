## 🔍 Review Rule

* At every stage, **one teammate acts as review support**.
* The reviewer should be:

  * The person with the **lightest workload**, or
  * Someone whose task is **already mostly complete**
* No approval without review (except early design stages).

---

# 📅 Project Timeline

---

## 🧩 Phase 1: Design & Structure

### 📆 April 5

### ⚙️ Interface Definition (MANDATORY)

All members must agree on:

**Example:**

```cpp
movePlayer(direction)
updateScore(int points)
checkWinCondition()
```

# ⚠️ Non-Negotiable Rules

* ❌ No feature development during testing days
* ❌ No unstable features — remove them immediately
* ✅ Simplicity > complexity
* ✅ All tasks must be completed **before testing begins**
* 🔄 Review support role rotates per stage

---

## 💡 Final Note

This plan only works if you actually enforce it.
If you let people “delay integration” or “add quick features during testing,” the whole thing collapses.
